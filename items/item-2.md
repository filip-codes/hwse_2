# Description

As a user<br />
I want to be able to generate different occupancy patterns/percentages.<br />
So that I can see how many students fit in the room at the specific pattern

## Acceptance criteria

### 1.
---
Given that I am a user and I have defined the room size and layout<br />
when I select a specific occupancy pattern or percentage from a dropdown menu<br />
then the system should generate a visualization of the number of students that can fit in the room using that occupancy pattern or percentage.

### 2.
---
Given that I am a user and I have generated a visualization for a specific occupancy pattern or percentage<br />
when I modify the room size or layout<br />
then the system should update the visualization to reflect the new number of students that can fit in the room using the same occupancy pattern or percentage.

### 3.
---
Given that I am a user and I have generated a visualization for a specific occupancy pattern or percentage<br />
when I select a different occupancy pattern or percentage from the dropdown menu<br />
then the system should generate a new visualization that shows the number of students that can fit in the room using the new occupancy pattern or percentage.
